THIS IS A FORK of Original repository that was abandoned.
It is fixed and emoji collage can now be sent as an attachment. I might look into code again and do proper autosend sometime soon.

<h1 align="center">EmojiParty</h1>
<p id="screenshot" align="center">

<a href="#screenshot"><img src="/EmojiParty.png" alt="Emoji Party in action." title="Use any emote!"></a>

Create a nice image from your emojis! You can include some text optionally too!

All you need to do to activate the plugin is to put 5 or more emojis in your message, you can even use nitro emojis in the image even without nitro.

This is kind of an alternative to FreeEmojis so there might be compatibility issues.
